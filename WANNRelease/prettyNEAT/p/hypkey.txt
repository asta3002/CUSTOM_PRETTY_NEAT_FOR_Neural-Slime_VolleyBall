NEAT Algorithm Hyperparameter Definitions:

=== Core Algorithm ===
task                - Target environment/task name (need to update task_gym, make_env)
maxGen              - Number of generations to run NEAT
popSize             - Maximum population size
alg_nReps           - Number of times each individual gets tested (mean reward calculated)
alg_speciate        - Enables speciation mechanism
alg_probMoo         - Enables multiobjective optimization
alg_act             - Choose the range of activation functions

=== Mutation Probabilities ===
prob_addConn        - Probability of adding a new connection (helps control network complexification)
prob_addNode        - Probability of adding a new node (helps control network complexity)
prob_crossover      - Probability of crossover (beneficial genes from both parents)
prob_enable         - Probability of re-enabling disabled connections (allows resurrection of useful connections)
prob_mutAct         - Probability of mutating the activation function
prob_mutConn        - Probability of mutating connection weights
prob_initEnable     - Probability of all connections being enabled at initialization

=== Selection Parameters ===
select_cullRatio    - Percent of bottom performers to remove from population
select_eliteRatio   - Percent of top performers to preserve (ensures top performers are not lost)
select_rankWeight   - Ranking weight method ("exp" for exponential, "lin" for linear)
select_tournSize    - Tournament size for parent selection

=== Speciation Parameters ===
spec_compatMod      - Compatibility threshold adjustment rate (how fast threshold adapts)
spec_dropOffAge     - Number of generations to hold a species without improvement before penalty
spec_target         - Target number of species to maintain
spec_thresh         - Compatibility distance threshold for species assignment
spec_threshMin      - Minimum threshold floor (prevents threshold from going too low)
spec_geneCoef       - Gene difference coefficient in compatibility distance calculation (c1=c2)
spec_weightCoef     - Weight difference coefficient in compatibility distance calculation (c3)

=== Other ===
save_mod            - Save modifier/probability
bestReps            - Number of validation trials for best individual
